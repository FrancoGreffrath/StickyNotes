The Sticky Notes Task Manager is a web-based application built with Django that allows users to create, view, update, and delete sticky notes. The application is designed to demonstrate core web development concepts, including MVC architecture, CRUD operations, and automated testing.

This project was developed as part of a practical assignment to reinforce software design, testing, and best development practices.
